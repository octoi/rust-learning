# CORE UTILS

Command-line utilities are the gateway to learning any programming language. They have simplified input and output systems which makes the code less complex to write. This allows you to focus on the problem at hand and learn Rust instead of learning a specific problem domain.

Rewriting existing tools in Rust can provide a great baseline to get started:

1. `echo`: repeats input
2. `cat`: concatenates files
3. `ls`: lists directories
4. `find`: locates files or directories
5. `grep`: matches text in files
